* DS03_C

### Data Source(s) Description:  
Tract-level variables were obtained from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) [Social Vulnerability Index 2018](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/data_documentation_download.html). Data was accessed on April 12, 2021. Raw data is downloaded in the folder of data_raw/SVI. 

The CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index  uses 15 U.S. census variables to help local officials identify communites that may need support before, during, or after disasters. Each tract is ranked on 15 social factors, including poverty,  lack of vehicle access, and crowded housing, and are grouped into four related themes to identify vulnerable populations. For more on Index, how it can be used, and what it measures, please refer to the complete [CDC SVI documentation, FAQ, and interactive map](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html). 

### Description of Data Processing: 
The following variables were included from the source data:

1. Socioeconomic – RPL_THEME1;
2. Household Composition & Disability – RPL_THEME2
3. Minority Status & Language – RPL_THEME3
4. Housing Type & Transportation – RPL_THEME4
5. Overall summary ranking - RPL_THEMES

For county-level estimates, Census tracts were grouped by counties and their estimates were averaged. 

For ZCTA-level estimates, because Census tracts do not map neatly onto ZCTA boundaries, we used a [HUD USPS ZIP-Tract Crosswalk File](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/usps_crosswalk.html) to take the weighted mean of the percentage of addresses in each tract that falls into the ZCTA. The ZCTA-level estimates exclude NAs or those observations coded as -999.
