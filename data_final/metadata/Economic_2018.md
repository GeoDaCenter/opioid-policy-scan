### Data Source(s) Description:  

Variables were obtained from the [2014 - 2018 American Community Survey (ACS)](https://data.census.gov), tables B19301, DP03, and B19301, at the state, county, tract and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels.

The ACS is an ongoing survey that provides vital information on a yearly basis about our nation and its people. Learn more about the ACS [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html). 

### Description of Data Source Tables:

**Table B19301**: Per capita income in the past 12 months (in 2018 inflation-adjusted dollars) <br>

**Table DP03**: Selected Economic Characteristics <br>

**Table S1701:** Poverty status in the past 12 months

### Description of Data Processing: 

The following variables were included from **B19301**.

  * **Estimate; Per capita income in the past 12 months (in 2018 inflation-adjusted dollars)**. Per capita income is the mean income computed for every man, woman, and child in a particular group including those living in group quarters. It is derived by dividing the aggregate income of a particular group by the total population in that group. This measure is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Note: Employment and unemployment estimates may vary from the official labor force data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics because of differences in survey design and data collection. 
  
The following variables were included from **DP03**:
  * **Percent estimate; Unemployment Rate**. The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed individuals as a percentage of the civilian labor force. 
 
The following variables were included from **S1701**:
  * **Percent Estimate; Percent below poverty level**. The total number of people below the poverty level is the sum of people in families and the number of unrelated individuals with incomes in the last 12 months below the poverty threshold. Note: Poverty status was determined for all people except institutionalized people, people in military group quarters, people in college dormitories, and unrelated individuals under 15 years old. These groups were excluded from the numerator and denominator when calculating poverty rates.
