### Data Location: 
You can find the variables described in this document in the CSV files [here](../full_tables).  

CSV files are organized by **year** and **spatial scale**. For example, county-level variables from 2000 will be found in C_2000.csv.  
Note: Every variable can be found in the **Latest** files.

### Data Source(s) Description:  
Variables were obtained from the Vera Institute of Justice. Raw data and more details can be found at https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration_trends. Raw data is downloaded in the folder of data_raw, named "incarceration_trends.xlsx". 


### Description of Data Processing: 
The following variables were included from the source data:
1. Total jail population rate;
2. Female jail population rate;
3. Male jail population rate; 
4. Asian American/Pacific Islander jail population rate;
5. Black jail population rate;
6. Latinx jail population rate; 
7. Native American jail population rate;
8. White jail population rate;
9. Total jail admission rate;
10. Pretrial jail population rate;
11. Total jail population count;
12. Female jail population count;
13. Male jail population count; 
14. Asian American/Pacific Islander jail population count;
15. Black jail population count;
16. Latinx jail population count; 
17. Native American jail population count;
18. White jail population count;
19. Total jail admission count;
20. Pretrial jail population count. 
 
These rates were calculated using base rate of county population aged 15-64 and the unit is per 100K people. They argue that "youth under age 15 and adults over 64 are age groups at very low risk of jail incarceration and because the proportion of these groups varies greatly by county." Also, note that these rates are jail population relative to the total county population. For example, the female jail population rate is calculated as the jail female population divided by the female population (aged 15â€“64) in that county (multiplied by 100,000).
