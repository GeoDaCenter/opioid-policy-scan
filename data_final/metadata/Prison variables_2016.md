### Data Source(s) Description:  
Variables were obtained from the Vera Institute of Justice. Raw data and more details can be found at https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration_trends. Raw data is downloaded in the folder of data_raw, named as "incarceration_trends.xlsx".

 2. Female prison population rate;
 3. Male prison population rate;
 4. Asian American/Pacific Islander prison population rate;
 5. Black prison population rate;
 6. Latinx prison population rate;
 7. Native American prison population rate;
 8. White prison population rate;
 9. Total prison admission rate;
 10. Female prison admission rate;
 11. Male prison admission rate;
 12. Asian American/Pacific Islander prison admission rate;
 13. Black prison admission rate;
 14. Latinx prison admission rate;
 15. Native American prison admission rate;
 16. White prison admission rate;
 17. Total prison population count;
 18. Female prison population count;
 19. Male prison population count;
 20. Asian American/Pacific Islander prison population count;
 21. Black prison population count;
 22. Latinx prison population count;
 23. Native American prison population count;

 29. Black prison admission count;
 30. Latinx prison admission count;
 31. Native American prison admission count;
 32. White prison admission count.
 
These rates were calculated using base rate of county population aged 15-64. They argue that "youth under age 15 and adults over 64 are age groups at very low risk of jail incarceration and because the proportion of these groups varies greatly by county."
