### Data Location: 
Access04 at 2 spatial scales. Files can be found [here](/data_final).
* Access05_T  
* Access05_Z  

### Data Source(s) Description:  
Mental health provider data was sourced from [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA)](https://www.samhsa.gov/) through its [Treatment Services Locator Tool](https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/locator). 

ZIP Code Tract Area (ZCTA) and Census Tract files were sourced from the [US Census Bureau, TIGER/Line Shapefiles 2018](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html). 

### Description of Data Source Tables: 
The source SAMSHA mental health provider dataset includes provider name, location (address, city, state, zip, county, latitude and longitude), and contact information (website, phone number).

### Description of Data Processing: 
Data was scraped from the SAMSHA Treatment Locator tool, filtered for mental health providers, cleaned, and then converted to spatial data. Next, we conducted a nearest resource analysis using minimum Euclidean distance as a proxy variable for access. This analysis included calculating centroids for all census tracts and ZCTAs, identifying the nearest mental health provider to each centroid, and calculating the distance in miles. 

### Key Variable and Definitions:

| Variable | Variable ID in .csv | Description |
|:---------|:--------------------|:------------|
| Access to mental health providers | minDisMH | Euclidean distance from centroid to nearest mental health provider, in miles |
| ZIP Code Tract Area (ZCTA) | ZCTA | Unique 5-digit assigned ZCTA, usually same as ZIP code |
| Tract GEOID | GEOID | Unique 11-digit GEOID for census tracts (state + county + tract) |
| State | STATEFP | Unique 2-digit ID for states |
| County | COUNTYFP | 3-digit ID for counties |
| Census Tract | TRACTCE | 6-digit ID for census tracts |

### Data Limitations:
Euclidean or straight-line distance is a simple approximation of access or travel from an origin centroid to the nearest hospital. It is not a precise calculation of real travel times or distances.  

### Comments/Notes:
The final dataset includes US states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, but does not include other territories (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Palau). ZCTA and tract centroids are not population-weighted.
