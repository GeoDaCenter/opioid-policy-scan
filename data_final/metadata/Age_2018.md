### Data Location: 
DS01 at 4 spatial scales. Files can be found [here](/data_final).
* DS01_T  
* DS01_Z  
* DS01_C  
* DS01_S  

### Data Source(s) Description:  
Variables were obtained from the 2014 - 2018 American Community Survey (ACS), table S0101, at State, County, Tract and ZIP Code Tabulation Area level. Raw data and more details can be found at https://data.census.gov.

### Description of Data Source Tables:
S0101 : Age & Sex

### Description of Data Processing: 
The following variables were included from **S0101**:
  1.	Estimate; Age – Under 5 years
  2.	Estimate; Selected Age Categories – 5 to 14 years
  3.	Estimate; Age – 15 to 19 years 
  4.	Estimate; Age – 20 to 24 years 
  5.	Estimate; Selected Age Categories - 15 to 44 years
  6.	Estimate; Age - 45 to 49 years
  7.	Estimate; Age - 50 to 54 years
  8.	Estimate; Age - 55 to 59 years
  9.	Estimate; Age - 60 to 64 years
  10.	Estimate; Selected Age Categories – 65 years and over
  11.	Estimate; Selected Age Categories – 18 years and over

----------
Three age categories were calculated using these variables, population between age 15-24, population under the age of 45 and population over the age of 65. 
All three variables were then converted to percentages using total population as the base.

### Key Variable and Definitions:
| Variable | Variable ID in .csv | Description |
|:---------|:--------------------|:------------|
| Total population between age 18-64 | age18_64 | Total adult population under age 65 |
| Total population between age 0-4 | age0_4 | Total population between age 0-4 |
| Total population between age 5-14 | age0_4 | Total population between age 5-14 |
| Total population between age 15-19 | age15_19 | Total population between age 15-19 |
| Total population between age 20-24 | age20_24 | Total population between age 20-24 |
| Total population between age 15-44 | age15_44 | Total population between age 15-44 |
| Total population between age 45-49 | age40_49 | Total population between age 45-49 |
| Total population between age 50-54 | age50_54 | Total population between age 50-54 |
| Total population between age 55-59 | age55_59 | Total population between age 55-59 |
| Total population between age 60-64 | age60_64 | Total population between age 60-64 |
| Total population at or over age 65 | ageOv65 | Total population at or over age 65 |
| % Population between 15-24 years | a15_24P | Percentage of population between ages of 15 & 24 |
| % Population under 45  | und45P | Percentage of population below 45 years of age |
| % Population over 65 | ovr65P | Percentage of population over 65 |
