### Data Location: 
You can find the variables described in this document in the CSV files [here](../full_tables).  

CSV files are organized by **year** and **spatial scale**. For example, county-level variables from 2000 will be found in C_2000.csv.  
Note: Every variable can be found in the **Latest** files.

### Data Source(s) Description:  
Variables were obtained from the 2014 - 2018 American Community Survey (ACS), table S0101, at State, County, Tract and ZIP Code Tabulation Area level. Raw data and more details can be found at https://data.census.gov.

### Description of Data Source Tables:
S0101 : Age & Sex

### Description of Data Processing: 
The following variables were included from **S0101**:
  1.	Estimate; Age – Under 5 years
  2.	Estimate; Selected Age Categories – 5 to 14 years
  3.	Estimate; Age – 15 to 19 years 
  4.	Estimate; Age – 20 to 24 years 
  5.	Estimate; Selected Age Categories - 15 to 44 years
  6.	Estimate; Age - 45 to 49 years
  7.	Estimate; Age - 50 to 54 years
  8.	Estimate; Age - 55 to 59 years
  9.	Estimate; Age - 60 to 64 years
  10.	Estimate; Selected Age Categories – 65 years and over
  11.	Estimate; Selected Age Categories – 18 years and over

----------
Three age categories were calculated using these variables, population between age 15-24, population under the age of 45 and population over the age of 65. 
All three variables were then converted to percentages using total population as the base.

### Key Variable and Definitions:

- **Variable** -- title of variable
- **Variable ID** -- exact name of variable in datasets
- **Description** -- Short description of variable
- **Years Available** -- years for which data exists for this variable
- **Spatial Scale** -- the variable exists for these levels of spatial scale
