### Data Location: 
Access04 at 2 spatial scales. Files can be found [here](/data_final).
* Access04_T  
* Access04_Z  

### Data Source(s) Description:  
Pharmacy locations were sourced from the InfoGroup (now [Data Axle](https://www.data-axle.com/)) 2019 Business and Consumer Historical Datafile, available through the University of Chicago Library.

Zip code tract area (ZCTA) and Census Tract files were sourced from the [US Census Bureau, TIGER/Line Shapefiles 2018](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html). 

### Description of Data Source Tables: 
The source InfoGroup dataset includes the business name, location (address, city, state, census tract, latitude, longitude), NAICS Code, and NAICS Code Description variables. 

### Description of Data Processing: 
Data was downloaded and sourced from InfoGroup's historical dataset, filtered for pharmacies via [NAICS class code](https://www.naics.com/naics-code-description/?code=446110) 4461100, cleaned, and then converted to spatial data. Next, the nearest resource analysis was conducted using minimum Euclidean distance as a proxy variable for access. This analysis included calculating centroids for all U.S. census tracts and ZCTAs, identifying the nearest pharmact to each tract/zip centroid, then measuring the distance in miles.

### Key Variable and Definitions:

| Variable | Variable ID in .csv | Description |
|:---------|:--------------------|:------------|
| GEOID | GEOID | Unique 11-digit GEOID, including state, county, and tract IDs |
| State | STATEFP | Unique 2-digit ID for states |
| County | COUNTYFP | 3-digit ID for counties |
| Census Tract | TRACTCE | 6-digit ID for census tracts |
| ZIP Code Tract Area (ZCTA) | ZCTA | Unique 5-digit assigned ZCTA, usually same as ZIP Code |
| Access to pharmacies | minDisRx | Euclidean distance from tract or zip centroid to nearest pharmacy, in miles |

### Data Limitations:
Euclidean distance or straight-line is a simple approximation of access or travel from an origin centroid to the nearest hospital. It is not a precise calculation of real travel times or distances.

### Comments/Notes:
The final dataset includes US states and Washington, D.C., but does not include territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Palau). ZCTA and tract centroids are not population-weighted.
