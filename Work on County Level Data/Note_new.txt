1.The table key is GEOID and GEOID_C repectively for county Level data and tract level data, which is combined by STATEFP (2 digits) + COUNTYFP (3 digits) 

2."GetVeteran_CountyLevel" is a R script to read local veteran file, calculating correct GEOID(table key) and do related calculation, which has been uploaded tom GitHub

3."Tract&County_Merged code.py" file can get the table on county level after merging tract level & calculating the percentage for all Access variables. Some variables from tract level data are removed from merged table

4.Remove several variables, including "walking time" variables & "biking time" variables for these cannot be calculated based on tract level data, and not necessary data. Meanwhile, the "min distance" and "Count of providers in 30 minute drive time threshold" variables are also be removed. However, the percentage of tracts with these variables were calculated, named original variable names + "P"

5."T&C_Merged_Table" is the result of "Merged_C&T_Code.py"

6. Some other new variables are below: 
	SpPerCap = TotPop/TotSp
  	PcpPerCap = TotPop/Totpcp
  	ChildrenP = TotPop - AgeOv18
	CNT_T: the total number of tracts in each county

7. "original_county_level_data" and "Original Data Dictionary for County Level Data" is merged table only including county level data from metadata without data from tract level data
