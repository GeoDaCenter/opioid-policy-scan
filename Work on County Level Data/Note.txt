1.The table key is GEOID and GEOID_C repectively for county Level data and tract level data, which is combined by STATEFP (2 digits) + COUNTYFP (3 digits) 

2."GetVeteran_CountyLevel" is a R script to read local veteran file, calculating correct GEOID(table key) and do related calculation, which has been uploaded to GitHub

3."GetMergedTable_County_Tract_level.py" file can get the table on county level after merging tract level & calculating the percentage for some of Access variables. 

4.Remove several variables, including: 'NalTmBk', 'SutMinDis', 'OtpMinDis', 'MoudMinDis', 'MetTmWk', 'RxMinDis', 'HospMinDis', 'NalMinDis', 'MetTmBk', 'BupMinDis', 'FqhcMinDis', 
'MhMinDis', 'MetMinDis', 'BupTmBk', 'NalTmWk', 'BupTmWk', 'TRACTCE', 'OtpCntDr', 'HospCntDr', 'MetCntBk60', 'BupCntDr30', 'MetCntBk30', 'MetCntWk60', 'NalCntBk30', 'BupCntWk60', 
'MetCntDr30', 'BupCntBk60', 'NalCntWk30', 'BupCntWk30', 'BupCntBk30', 'FqhcCntDr', 'NalCntDr30', 'RxCntDr', 'MetCntWk30', 'MhCntDr', 'NalCntWk60', 'NalCntBk60', 'SutCntDr'

However, create variables including 'MetCntWk30P', 'BupCntWk30P', 'OtpCntDrP', 'NalCntBk30P', 'RxCntDrP', 'MhCntDrP', 'BupCntWk60P', 'NalCntWk60P', 'NalCntWk30P', 'BupCntBk30P', 
'MetCntBk60P', 'HospCntDrP', 'SutCntDrP', 'BupCntDr30P', 'FqhcCntDrP', 'BupCntBk60P', 'NalCntBk60P', 'MetCntWk60P', 'NalCntDr30P', 'MetCntDr30P', 'MetCntBk30P'

5."C_Latest" is the result of "GetMergedTable_County_Tract_level.py"

6. Some other new variables are below: 
	SpPerCap = TotSp/100,000
  	PcpPerCap = TotPcp/100,000
  	ChildrenP = TotPop - AgeOv18
	CNT_T: the total number of tracts in each county
    all "percentage" variables for access variables = the count of tracts which valuabel is not 0/Total count of tracts in one county

7. "original_county_level_data.csv" is merged table only including county level data from metadata without data from tract level data

8. What is changed on Tuesday:
    a. TRACTCE was removed
    b. SpPerCap, PcpPerCap was recalculated(beased on "PerCap" means per 100,000 persons according to tract level data)
    c. the Python script was rename as "GetMergedTable_County_Tract_level.py"
    d. The name for final merged table was changed to "C_Latest"
    e. Percentage variables for TmWk, TmBk, and MinDis were removed
    f. update dictionary named "DataDictionary_CountyLevel" including all variables in merged table nows

9. More information for created variables should be added after checking with Dr. Kolak

Tips: MedInc data has been merged into original_county_level_data.csv
      if the source is empty, that means that the variabels is calculated based on tract level data
      note variable is red for reminding
      Totpop10 etc did not be removed waiting for checking with Dr. Kolak
      All refined files are still in "Work on County Level Data" dictionary for future checking
